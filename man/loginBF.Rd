\description{
\code{loginBF} logs in to Betfair, via the API-NG JSON interactive end point.
}
\details{
This login function \strong{must be executed first}, before any other
functions in this package. Failure to execute \code{loginBF} renders
everything else pointless. You will require a valid Betfair username,
password and application key. Obtain a Betfair application key by following
the instructions here:

\url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Application+Keys}

\code{username}, \code{password} and \code{applicationKey} are all mandatory
and must be user defined.

Every time \code{loginBF} is executed, a new login to Betfair occurs. Don't
login more than is necessary.
}
\section{Note on \code{credentials} variable}{
 This variable stores the
  defined Betfair username and password. R function objects are ephemeral.
  This variable dies immediately after function execution. Your Betfair
  username and password is not stored anywhere outside this function and
  details must always be passed to the function on execution.
}

\section{Note on \code{headersPostLogin} variable}{
 This variable is global.
  It stores the session based authentication token and is required for all
  other functions in this package.
